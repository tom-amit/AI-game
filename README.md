# Instructions
Upon execution you will get a window with the board seen.  
 - If you want to play localy, use the setup controls:  
    - Standard setup will place pawns in their regular placements and start the game
    - You can add white and black pawns by hand, choose what you want to add and then click on the tile you want, when you finish press _finish setup_ to start
  
   To enable the AI you have 2 checkboxes which control whether you have the AI for each player enabled  
   Be aware that while the AI is thinking you cant interact with the UI so if you turn on both AI's you lose control of the UI until the match ends
  
   You can also press the Undo last move to go back moves.  
  
  
 - If you want the AI to connect to a server
    - enter the ip and port to the text boxes, and press connect
   
   the visuals will not update for that but you can see the data transmitted on the terminal
